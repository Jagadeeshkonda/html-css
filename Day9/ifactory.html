                                        <b>YOU NEED TO BE SEARCH ENGINE SAVVY</b> <br>
                                    one of the biggest problems that parallex website face is that they are not SEO friendly. Why? When you limit the number of pages on your website, Google has fewer pages to index and negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results (SERP).
                     
                                </p>

                                </div>

                                <section class = "skew7">
                                    <div class = "contain7">

                                        <p>
                                            50% of website users bounce off pages if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the more high resolution imagery and animations your include, the longer it takes to load the page.
                                    </p>
                                    </div>

                                            <p>
                                                Instead of hitting the "back" button, users must scroll back up the <br> page which can be frustrating for users who want to refer back to a certain elements. An easy way around this is to include top navigation.
                                            
                                        </p>
